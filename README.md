<p>MSc Cybersecurity student at the University of Sunderland (Graduating Summer of 2025) with a strong passion for Blue Team security. I am a passionate and active learner, regularly building and working on projects to gain hands-on experience with a diverse range of industry-standard security tools. These projects focus on Blue Team domains, and were carried out with best security practices in mind, in a secure homelab environment either with cloud computing, or my own local virtual homelab.
 
Through this experience I am to transition careers, from my 9+ years experience in a leading IT company as a frontline support team member, to a cybersecurity professional. Beyond the outlined projects below and my MSc, I'm also building hands-on experience through a variety of certifications and labs ‚Äî including the Blue Team Level 1, AWS Certified Cloud Practioner, and TryHackMe's interactive labs and CTF challenges.
