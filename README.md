<p>Hi, I'm Jake üëã. I'm an MSc Cybersecurity student at the University of Sunderland (Graduating Summer of 2025) with a strong passion for Blue Team security. I‚Äôm actively working on projects in cloud computing, python programming, and artifact collection and analysis. Through these projects, I'm building hands-on experience with a diverse range of security tools, continuously developing my skills and knowledge as an aspiring cybersecurity professional. Beyond my MSc program, I'm continuously building hands-on experience through a variety of certifications and labs ‚Äî including the Blue Team Level 1 and interactive CTF challenges on TryHackMe.
